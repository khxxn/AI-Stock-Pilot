    "summary": "Alphabet's self-driving unit Waymo said on Tuesday it aims to launch its fully autonomous ride-hailing service in the U.S. capital city next year.  Waymo began moving vehicles to Washington, D.C., in January and will bring more to the city in the coming weeks as it works to start paid commercial services as soon as next year.  \"We will also work closely with policymakers to formalize the legal framework needed to operate without a human behind the wheel, as Washington, D.C. does not currently allow for fully autonomous operations,\" Waymo said on Tuesday."

    "provider": "Associated Press Finance",
    "summary": "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.  For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong — a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.  While the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app."

    "summary": "Ark Investment Management, which was founded by prolific technology investor Cathie Wood, thinks the autonomous ride-hailing industry could generate $14 trillion in enterprise value by 2027.  Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is a leading developer of self-driving technologies, and its new Cybercab robotaxi -- which will be able to haul passengers with no human input -- could hit American roads as soon as this year.  Instead, I think Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) has the potential to capture a much bigger share of this new, multitrillion-dollar market."
